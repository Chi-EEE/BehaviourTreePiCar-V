# Reason to why I am using certain technologies to others for Raspberry Pi

## ROS (Robot Operating System)

### Why am I not using X for Raspberry Pi
When trying to install Ubuntu for the Raspberry Pi, I could not login into the raspberry pi because a login is required and even if the login isn't set, it still pops up a login screen. I have tried the username 'ubuntu' and password 'ubuntu' and I could still not login. 

I have also tried to install Raspbian Buster which might allow for ROS to get installed in it but I couldn't since the Raspberry Pi does not support older OS versions of Raspbian.

I am going to attempt to use docker for ROS
