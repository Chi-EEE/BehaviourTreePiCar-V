# Frontend

This sub-project contains the SPA (Single Page Application) of the website. 

We build the SPA before we serve it to the users to save processing power on the server.

## Installation

Run the following command to build the sub-project: 

```
pnpm run build
```

This process is not necessary as this sub-project is automatically built when running the `backend` sub-project.
